    <!-- 
      This file is actually not strictly needed if the project uses 
      project-details.html?id=virtual-try-on, but the 'url' in the object 
      points to project-details.html?id=... so we are good.
      However, the other projects have a folder with index.html (like ai-powered-dress-search/index.html).
      The 'virtual-try-on' project relies on the generic project-details.html page based on my config.
      
      Wait, looking at the other projects:
      - Dress Search: projects/ai-powered-dress-search/index.html (Custom page?)
      - Smart PDF: project-details.html?id=smart-pdf-lab
      - BCA Guidance: project-details.html?id=bca-guidance
      
      So 'Virtual Try On' can also just use project-details.html. 
      I don't need to create a specific index.html for it unless I want a custom demo page.
      The prompt didn't ask for a full demo, just to add the project.
      
      So I will NOT create this file. I'll rely on project-details.html.
